This is an ever-evolving personal website for capturing ideas, showcasing projects, and experimenting with front-end visualization and interactions.

## Site Structure

- `Blog`: Notes on tech, life, and design.
- `Project`: Personal projects and case studies, covering tech choices, implementation approaches, and previews.
- `Camera`: Photography and camera-related content, with occasional visual experiments.
- `Funny`: A collection of front-end interactions and little toys — mini-games, visualizations, particles, and noise experiments.
- `Gossip`: A casual place to chat and riff — share opinions and ideas.
- `Friend Link`: Friend links and recommended resources.

## About Me

Hey! I’m Voidis, a front-end developer passionate about open source and design engineering.

- Obsessed with turning ideas into usable, playful, and elegant products and interactions.
- I share front-end engineering and experience design from time to time, and also explore generative art and interaction experiments.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography and travel, and I love trying new tools and workflows to boost efficiency and creativity. If we share interests, drop a message in `Gossip` or find me via `Friend Link`.

If you enjoy my projects or articles, feel free to share them or discuss improvements with me. Let’s make creation more fun and keep open source sustainable.

## Contact & Thanks

If you're interested in the site’s content or implementation, feel free to find me via `Friend Link` or leave a message in `Gossip`. Thanks for visiting and reading!
