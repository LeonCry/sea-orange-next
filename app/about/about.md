Welcome to my blog website, [seaci.me](<(https://seaci.me)>)! This is where I record and share my lifeâ€™s little moments, and I hope you find resonance and joy here.

In this **blog**, you will see the articles I write, which are my thoughts and insights on life, technology, and design. I hope to share my perspectives and experiences with you through these words, and I also look forward to your feedback and exchanges.

In addition to words, I also enjoy using my **camera** to capture the beautiful moments in life. In the Camera section, you can appreciate some of the photos I have taken, and I hope these images bring you joy.

Front-end design has always been my passion. In the Funny section, I will share some **funny** front-end design demos. These works not only showcase my technical skills but also reflect my pursuit of beauty.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to share them in the **Gossip** section. This is a place for democratic expression, where everyone can voice their opinions and perspectives.

Furthermore, the Project section showcases some of my personal projects. These projects are my attempts at exploring and innovating in technology, and I hope through these projects, I can realize my own value and also inspire you.

Finally, thank you for **visiting**!
